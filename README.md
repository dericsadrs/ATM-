PROBLEM DEFINITION
	
The programmers must create a program similarly on how an Automated Teller Machine works. The programmers can freely construct the program using their own  Algorithm given that it should be simple, optimized and provides the best convenience to its user. 

OBJECTIVE
  	The code created by the programmer aimed to provide a similar process on how an Automated Teller Machine works and to provide convenience to its user. With that the programers seeks to accomplish the following:
To come up with the proper Algorithm to  be used for the Program


To provide the following transaction process of the Automated Teller Machine  to the user.
Inquiry/Check Balance
Withdraw
Deposit
Change PIN
Load Mobile
Fund Transfer
Fund transfer Record
Exit
To be able to store and save the following Account User’s data and also the changes made to some of it by the user.
Account Number
Last name, First name, and Middle name
Contact Number
Current Balance
PIN/Account Pass Code
To provide the needed constraints which will be a factor in providing convenience to its user.


SCOPE and LIMITATION
	The coverage of the program focuses on the transactions available to the Automated Teller Machine. 
For accessing the program the user is given three chances to input a valid/existing Account number and another three chances of input for the PIN. In Checking of Balance and Checking of Transfer History there’s no return or cancel choice given for the user can proceed to the menu with a return input. For Withdrawal and Depositing, there is no limitation to the amount in which a user can deposit. 
These first four transactions are some of the  processes that do not come with three chances of correct input for those four can be easily accessed again or the inputs are less complicated than the others. 
And for the other four remaining available transactions, except for the first input of the transaction process, the program provides  three more chances of input just in case the user accidentally/unintentionally entered an invalid input. And with that any changes in the User account will not take place when an account is logged in unless the user properly exits the program.

	There are some transactions that are not available in the program, these are creating a new Account, Changing of the Account Number and User Name, Changing of Contact Number, and Providing Balance caps. The program is also limited to Withdrawing, Buying Load, Transferring amount that is insufficient to the current balance of the user,  as well as transfering, buying load for an unexisting user contact Number and Account Number. Also the input of the user is limited to digits/numbers, so it can be assumed that there’s no characters that’s available in the machine’s keypad.
